# INTRODUCTION

Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company headquartered in Chicago, boasts a fleet of over 5,800 bicycles and operates 600 docking stations. While a significant portion of its user base utilizes the bikes for leisurely activities, approximately 30% rely on them for daily commuting. Historically, Cyclistic's marketing efforts have prioritized broad consumer outreach and brand awareness. The company provides single-day and full-day passes for occasional riders and offers annual subscriptions for dedicated members.

Through data analysis, Cyclistic has determined that annual members yield greater profitability compared to casual riders. As a result, the company aims to focus on increasing the number of annual memberships to drive future growth. Rather than targeting entirely new customers, Cyclistic plans to launch a targeted marketing campaign aimed at converting casual users into annual members. To facilitate this transition, Cyclistic seeks to better understand the distinctions between casual users and members through an in-depth analysis of historical trip data. This strategic approach will inform the development of tailored marketing strategies aimed at achieving the objective of boosting annual memberships.
